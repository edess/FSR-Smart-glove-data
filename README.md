# FSR-Smart-glove-data
Data collected during the experiment with the FSR smart-glove

The participants were asked to perform the 10 selected fit- ness exercises while wearing the smart-glove. Each exercise is executed 3 times (3 sets for each exercise), at the participantâ€™s natural speed and pace, to make the experiment more realistic. Each set lasts for 30 seconds, and the participants were allowed to take 1 or 2 minute-break between the sets. During the break time, the glove was turned off by the participants to save battery. The ordering of the exercise was randomized, each participant freely chose the order in which he/she wants to perform the exercise.
